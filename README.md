# Convex Clustering

This is a sample code of Convex Clustering.
I referred a paper, "_Convex Clustering with Exemplar-Based Models_" to write the code.
Fundamental algorithm is implemented but any optimization is not implemented.
For running this code, you need to call convex_clustering.py which includes a main function.

I recommend that you read the original paper to get more knowledge about Convex Clustering.
If you are Japanese, I also recommend that you read "[_ZOKU WAKARIYASUI Pattern Recognition_](http://shop.ohmsha.co.jp/shopdetail/000000000574/)".

The motivation of the code is a survey for my research.
So, this code may be a little wrong.
If you find a bug, please inform me of the bug.
